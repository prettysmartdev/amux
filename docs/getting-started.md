# Getting Started with amux

`amux` is a terminal multiplexer for code and claw agents. This guide gets you from zero to running multiple containerized agent sessions in the TUI.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Git** — your project must be in a Git repository
- **Docker** — a running Docker daemon ([Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- **A supported agent** — Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode installed and authenticated on your machine. NanoClaw for persistent 24/7 agents.

---

## Installation

```sh
curl -s https://prettysmart.dev/install/amux.sh | sh
```

The installer detects your platform and installs `amux` to `/usr/local/bin`.

<summary>Other installation options</summary>

**From GitHub Releases** — download the binary for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/prettysmartdev/amux/releases), make it executable, and move it onto your `PATH`:

```sh
chmod +x amux-*
mv amux-* /usr/local/bin/amux
```

**From source** — requires Rust 1.94+ and make:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/prettysmartdev/amux.git
cd amux
make install    # builds and installs to /usr/local/bin/amux
```

</details>

---

## First-time setup

Navigate to your project's Git root and run:

```sh
amux init
```

This creates `aspec/.amux.json` (repo config), downloads a `Dockerfile.dev` template for your agent, and offers to run an agent audit that customizes the Dockerfile for your project's actual toolchain. It then builds the dev container image.

To verify everything is ready:

```sh
amux ready
```

This checks Docker, verifies your agent is installed and authenticated (by sending a test greeting and showing the response), and confirms the dev container image exists. Use `--refresh` to re-run the Dockerfile audit and rebuild the image:

```sh
amux ready --refresh
```

---

## Opening the TUI

```sh
amux
```

The TUI opens with a tab bar at the top, an execution window in the middle, and a command input box at the bottom. Type any subcommand and press **Enter** to run it.

---

## Starting an agent session

### Freeform chat

```sh
chat
```

Launches an interactive agent session in a Docker container against your project. The container window opens as an overlay — all keyboard input is forwarded to the agent. Mouse scroll navigates terminal scrollback history.

### Implementing a work item

```sh
implement 0001
```

Launches the agent with a prompt to implement `aspec/work-items/0001-*.md`. The agent reads the spec, writes code, runs tests, and reports back — all inside the container.

### Creating and refining work items

```sh
specs new               # prompts for a type and title, creates the file
specs new --interview   # creates the file, then opens an agent session to help fill it out
specs amend 0001        # after implementing, have the agent update the spec to match reality
```

`specs new` offers four work item kinds: Feature, Bug, Task, and Enhancement. With `--interview`, the agent asks you questions and completes the spec based on your answers before any implementation starts. `specs amend` is useful for keeping specs accurate after the work is done — useful for ongoing maintenance and handoff context.

## Running multiple agents in parallel

Press **Ctrl+T** to open a new tab. Each tab gets its own working directory, execution window, and container session. Tabs keep running in the background when you switch away.

```
Ctrl+T          open a new tab
Ctrl+A / Ctrl+D navigate left / right between tabs
```

Tab colors show live state at a glance:

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Grey | Idle |
| Blue | Command running |
| Green | Agent container active |
| Purple | Claw session running |
| Red | Exited with error |
| Yellow | possible stuck agent |

A stuck tab (yellow, `⚠️` prefix) clears automatically when you switch to it or interact with it.

A practical workflow: open one tab to `implement` a work item, open another to `chat` about a different part of the codebase, and monitor both from the tab bar without leaving the TUI.

---

## Claw agent management

The `claws` commands manage a persistent [nanoclaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw) container — a long-lived, machine-global background agent with Docker socket access.

```sh
amux claws init     # first-time setup: fork, clone, build, and launch
amux claws ready    # check status; start the container if it's stopped
amux claws chat     # attach to a running nanoclaw container
```

Unlike `chat` and `implement` sessions (ephemeral, per-project), the nanoclaw container persists across `amux` sessions. It's designed for longer-running or cross-project work where you want a continuously available agent. Press **Ctrl+C** to detach — the container keeps running; run `claws chat` again to re-attach.

In the TUI, the nanoclaw tab is shown in purple.

---

## Container window controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| (typing) | Forwarded directly to the agent |
| **Esc** | Minimize container window (agent keeps running) |
| **c** | Restore minimized container window |
| Mouse scroll | Scroll terminal history |

When minimized, the container collapses to a 1-line status bar showing agent name, CPU, memory, and runtime. The outer execution window becomes fully visible for reading command output.

---

## Agent authentication

If your host agent is installed and authenticated, amux automatically and
transparently passes its credentials into the container — your account and
global settings are maintained without any prompting or manual configuration.

Credentials are passed as environment variables only — never as mounted files.
API key values are masked in all displayed Docker commands.

---

## Monitoring running agents

```sh
amux status          # one-shot snapshot of all running agent containers
amux status --watch  # auto-refreshing dashboard (updates every 3 seconds)
```

`status` works outside the TUI. It shows every active code agent session and the nanoclaw container with CPU usage, memory, project path, and runtime.

## What's next

- Read the [Usage Guide](usage.md) for all commands, flags, and TUI keyboard reference
- Use `--plan` on any session to have the agent analyse without modifying files: `amux chat --plan`
- Use `--allow-docker` to give an agent container access to the host Docker daemon when a task requires it
- Break complex work items into auditable phases with [Multi-Agent Workflows](workflows.md): `amux implement 0001 --workflow aspec/workflows/implement-feature.md`
